# 🤟 SignFy – AI Sign Language Translator

### 🌐 Bridging Communication Between Deaf and Hearing Communities

---

## 🧠 Overview

**SignFy** is an innovative mobile application that provides **real-time translation between sign language and spoken/written language** using Artificial Intelligence and Computer Vision.  
It aims to **break communication barriers** for deaf and mute individuals, making conversations seamless and inclusive in education, healthcare, workplaces, and daily life.

---

## 🎯 Main Objectives

- Enable **two-way communication** between deaf/mute and hearing individuals.  
- Use **AI-powered sign recognition** to interpret gestures into text or speech.  
- Support **reverse translation**: convert spoken or written text into sign language animations.  
- Promote **social inclusion** and **equal access** to information.

---

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. The camera captures the user’s **hand gestures and facial expressions**.  
2. The app uses **deep learning models** trained on sign language datasets to recognize signs.  
3. Detected signs are translated into **text or speech** in real time.  
4. Spoken words or typed text can be converted back into **animated sign language** for deaf users.
